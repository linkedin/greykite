    ``IS_EVENT_EXACT_COL``, ``IS_EVENT_ADJACENT_COL`` and ``IS_EVENT_COL``
    given the information in ``event_df_dict`` with the following logic:

        (1) If the key contains "_minus_" or "_plus_", that means the event
        was generated by the ``add_event_window`` function, and it is a
        neighboring day of some exact event day.
        In this case, ``IS_EVENT_ADJACENT_COL`` will be 1 for all days in this key.

        (2) Otherwise the key indicates that it is on the exact event day being modeled.
        In this case, ``IS_EVENT_EXACT_COL`` will be 1 for all days in this key.

        (3) If a date appears in both types of keys, both above columns will be 1.

        (4) ``IS_EVENT_COL`` is 1 for all dates in the provided ``event_df_dict``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    df : `pandas.DataFrame`
        The data frame which has a date column.
    event_df_dict : `dict` [`str`, `pandas.DataFrame`]
        A dictionary of data frames, each representing events data
        for the corresponding key.
        Values are DataFrames with two columns:

            - The first column contains the date. Must be at the same
              frequency as ``df[date_col]`` for proper join. Must be in a
              format recognized by `pandas.to_datetime`.
            - The second column contains the event label for each date

    date_col : `str`
        Column name in ``df`` that contains the dates for joining against
        the events in ``event_df_dict``.
    regular_day_label : `str`
        The label used for regular days which are not "events".
    neighbor_impact : `int`, `list` [`int`], callable or None, default None
        The impact of neighboring timestamps of the events in ``event_df_dict``.
        This is for daily events so the units below are all in days.

        For example, if the data is weekly ("W-SUN") and an event is daily,
        it may not exactly fall on the weekly date.
        But you can specify for New Year's day on 1-1, it affects all dates
        in the week, e.g. 12-31, 1-1, ..., 1-6, then it will be mapped to the weekly date.
        In this case you may want to map a daily event's date to a few dates,
        and can specify
        ``neighbor_impact=lambda x: [x-timedelta(days=x.isocalendar()[2]-1) + timedelta(days=i) for i in range(7)]``.

        Another example is that the data is rolling 7 day daily data,
        thus a holiday may affect the t, t+1, ..., t+6 dates.
        You can specify ``neighbor_impact=7``.

        If input is `int`, the mapping is t, t+1, ..., t+neighbor_impact-1.
        If input is `list`, the mapping is [t+x for x in neighbor_impact].
        If input is a function, it maps each daily event's date to a list of dates.
    shifted_effect : `list` [`str`] or None, default None
        Additional neighbor events based on given events.
        For example, passing ["-1D", "7D"] will add extra daily events which are 1 day before
        and 7 days after the given events.
        Offset format is {d}{freq} with any integer plus a frequency string. Must be parsable by pandas ``to_offset``.
        The new events' names will be the current events' names with suffix "{offset}_before" or "{offset}_after".
        For example, if we have an event named "US_Christmas Day",
        a "7D" shift will have name "US_Christmas Day_7D_after".
        This is useful when you expect an offset of the current holidays also has impact on the
        time series, or you want to interact the lagged terms with autoregression.
        If ``neighbor_impact`` is also specified, this will be applied after adding neighboring days.

    Returns

    label_col : `str`
        The column with labels for the events.
    time_delta : `str`, default "1D"
        The amount of the shift for each unit specified by a string
        e.g. '1D' stands for one day delta
    pre_num : `int`, default 1
        The number of events to be added prior to the given event for each event in df.
    post_num: `int`, default 1
        The number of events to be added after to the given event for each event in df.
    pre_post_num_dict : `dict` [`str`, (`int`, `int`)] or None, default None
        Optionally override ``pre_num`` and ``post_num`` for each key in ``event_df_dict``.
        For example, if ``event_df_dict`` has keys "US" and "India", this parameter
        can be set to ``pre_post_num_dict = {"US": [1, 3], "India": [1, 2]}``,
        denoting that the "US" ``pre_num`` is 1 and ``post_num`` is 3, and "India" ``pre_num`` is 1
        and ``post_num`` is 2. Keys not specified by ``pre_post_num_dict`` use the default given by
        ``pre_num`` and ``post_num``.

    -------
    df : `dict` [`str`, `pandas.DataFrame`]
        A dictionary of dataframes for each needed shift. For example if pre_num=2 and post_num=3.
