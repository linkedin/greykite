"""Defines an image scraper for sphinx-gallery
https://sphinx-gallery.github.io/
which can be used to show plotly output in documentation.
Adapted from the functions in plotly v4.6.0 to support:

    1. List of examples_dirs, gallery_dirs
    2. Do not render png thumbnail to avoid dependencies

Compatible with plotly 3.10.0.

    sphinx-gallery.
    Examples should use ``plotly.io.show()`` to display the figure with
    the custom sphinx_gallery renderer.
    Since the sphinx_gallery renderer generates both html and static png
    files, we simply crawl these files and give them the appropriate path.

    Original function:
        from plotly.io._sg_scraper import plotly_sg_scraper
    Which is based on:
        https://sphinx-gallery.github.io/stable/advanced.html#example-2-detecting-image-files-on-disk
    Modified to handle the case where examples_dirs is a list of more than one item.
        Original code failed to render plots for multiple directories:
            - Only the rendered the first directory
            - If multiple directories were specified, matplotlib plots in first directory were not rendered

    Parameters
    ----------
    block : tuple
        A tuple containing the (label, content, line_number) of the block.
    block_vars : dict
        Dict of block variables.
    gallery_conf : dict
        Contains the configuration of Sphinx-Gallery
    **kwargs : dict
        Additional keyword arguments to pass to
        :meth:`~matplotlib.figure.Figure.savefig`, e.g. ``format='svg'``.
        The ``format`` kwarg in particular is used to set the file extension
        of the output file (currently only 'png' and 'svg' are supported).
    Returns
    -------
