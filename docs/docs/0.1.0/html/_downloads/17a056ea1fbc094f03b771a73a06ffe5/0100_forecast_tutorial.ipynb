        "\nTune your first forecast model\n==============================\n\nThis is a basic tutorial for creating and tuning a forecast model.\nIt is intended to provide a basic sense of a forecast process without\nassuming background knowledge in forecasting.\n\nYou can use the ``PROPHET`` or ``SILVERKITE`` model.\nIn this tutorial, we focus on ``SILVERKITE``.\nHowever, the basic ideas of tuning are similar to both models.\nYou may see detailed information about ``PROPHET`` at\n`Prophet <../../pages/model_components/0100_introduction.html#prophet>`_.\n\n\n``SILVERKITE`` decomposes time series into various components, and it\ncreates time-based features, autoregressive features,\ntogether with user-provided features such as macro-economic features\nand their interactions, then performs a machine learning regression\nmodel to learn the relationship between the time series and these\nfeatures. The forecast is based on the learned relationship and\nthe future values of these features. Therefore, including the correct\nfeatures is the key to success.\n\nCommon features include:\n\n    Datetime derivatives:\n        Including features derived from datetime such as ``day of year``,\n        ``hour of day``, ``weekday``, ``is_weekend`` and etc.\n        These features are useful in capturing special patterns.\n        For example, the patterns of weekdays and weekends are different\n        for most business related time series, and this can be modeled with ``is_weekend``.\n    Growth:\n        First defines the basic feature ``ct1`` that counts how\n        long has passed in terms of years (could be fraction)\n        since the first day of training data.\n        For example, if the training data starts with \"2018-01-01\",\n        then the date has ``ct1=0.0``, and \"2018-01-02\" has ``ct1=1/365``.\n        \"2019-01-01\" has ``ct1=1.0``. This ``ct1`` can be as granular\n        as needed. A separate growth function can be applied to ``ct1``\n        to support different types of growth model. For example, ``ct2``\n        is defined as the square of ``ct1`` to model quadratic growth.\n    Trend:\n        Trend describes the average tendency of the time series.\n        It is defined through the growth term with possible changepoints.\n        At every changepoint, the growth rate could change (faster or slower).\n        For example, if ``ct1`` (linear growth) is used with changepoints,\n        the trend is modeled as piece-wise linear.\n    Seasonality:\n        Seasonality describes the periodical pattern of the time series.\n        It contains multiple levels including daily seasonality, weekly seasonality,\n        monthly seasonality, quarterly seasonality and yearly seasonality.\n        Seasonality are defined through Fourier series with different orders.\n        The greater the order, the more detailed periodical pattern the model\n        can learn. However, an order that is too large can lead to overfitting.\n    Events:\n        Events include holidays and other short-term occurrences that could\n        temporarily affect the time series, such as Thanksgiving long weekend.\n        Typically, events are regular and repeat at know times in the future.\n        These features made of indicators that covers the event day and their neighbor days.\n    Autoregression:\n        Autoregressive features include the time series observations\n        in the past and their aggregations. For example, the past day's observation,\n        the same weekday on the past week, or the average of the past 7 days, etc.\n        can be used. Note that autoregression features are very useful in short term\n        forecasts, however, this should be avoided in long term forecast.\n        The reason is that long-term forecast focuses more on the correctness\n        of trend, seasonality and events. The lags and autoregressive terms in\n        a long-term forecast are calculated based on the forecasted values.\n        The further we forecast into the future, the more forecasted values we\n        need to create the autoregressive terms, making the forecast less stable.\n    Custom:\n        Extra features that are relevant to the time series such as macro-ecomonic\n        features that are expected to affect the time series.\n        Note that these features need to be manually provided for both\n        the training and forecasting periods.\n    Interactions:\n        Any interaction between the features above.\n\nNow let's use an example to go through the full forecasting and tuning process.\nIn this example, we'll load a dataset representing ``log(daily page views)``\non the Wikipedia page for Peyton Manning.\nIt contains values from 2007-12-10 to 2016-01-20. More dataset info\n`here <https://facebook.github.io/prophet/docs/quick_start.html>`_.\n"

        "Evaluation metrics\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nFrom here we can see a list of metrics that measure the model performance on the test data.\nYou may choose one or a few metrics to focus on. Typical metrics include:\n\n  MSE:\n      Mean squared error, the average squared error. Could be affected by extreme values.\n\n  RMSE:\n      Root mean squared error, the square root of MSE.\n\n  MAE:\n      Mean absolute error, the average of absolute error. Could be affected by extreme values.\n\n  MedAE:\n      Median absolute error, the median of absolute error. Less affected by extreme values.\n\n  MAPE:\n      Mean absolute percent error, measures the error percent with respective to the true values.\n      This is useful when you would like to consider the relative error instead of the absolute error.\n      For example, an error of 1 is considered as 10% for a true observation of 10, but as 1% for a true\n      observation of 100. This is the default metric we like.\n\n  MedAPE:\n      Median absolute percent error, the median version of MAPE, less affected by extreme values.\n\nLet's use MAPE as our metric in this example. Looking at these results,\nyou may have a basic sense of how the model is performing on the unseen test data.\nOn average, the baseline model's prediction is 11.3% away from the true values.\n\nTime series cross-validation\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nForecast quality depends a lot of the evaluation time window.\nThe evaluation window selected above might happen to be a relatively easy/hard period to predict.\nThus, it is more robust to evaluate over a longer time window when dataset size allows.\nLet's consider a more general way of evaluating a forecast model: time series cross-validation.\n\nTime series cross-validation is based on a time series rolling split.\nLet's say we would like to perform an evaluation with a 3-fold cross-validation,\nThe whole training data is split in 3 different ways.\nSince our forecast horizon is 365 days, we do:\n\n    First fold:\n      Train from 2007-12-10 to 2013-01-20, forecast from\n      2013-01-21 to 2014-01-20, and compare the forecast with the actual.\n    Second fold:\n      Train from 2007-12-10 to 2014-01-20, forecast from\n      2014-01-21 to 2015-01-20, and compare the forecast with the actual.\n    Third fold:\n      Train from 2007-12-10 to 2015-01-20, forecast from\n      2015-01-21 to 2016-01-20, and compare the forecast with the actual.\n\nThe split could be more flexible, for example, the testing periods could have gaps.\nFor more details about evaluation period configuration, see\n`Evaluation Period <../../pages/stepbystep/0400_configuration.html#evaluation-period>`_.\nThe forecast model's performance will be the average of the three evaluations\non the forecasts.\n\nBy default, the results returned by :py:meth:`~greykite.framework.templates.forecaster.Forecaster.run_forecast_config`\nalso runs time series cross-validation internally.\nYou are allowed to configure the cross-validation splits, as shown below.\nHere note that the ``test_horizon`` are reserved from the back of\nthe data and not used for cross-validation.\nThis part of testing data can further evaluate the model performance\nbesides the cross-validation result, and is available for plotting.\n\n"

The documentation for\nextra regressors can be found at :Doc:`/pages/model_components/0700_regressors`. As mentioned\nin `Seasonality <../quickstart/0300_seasonality.html>`_, we observe that the football\nseason heavily affects the pageviews, therefore we need to use regressors to identify the football season.\nThere are multiple ways to include this feature: adding indicator for the whole season;\nadding number of days till season start (end) and number of days since season start (end).\nThe former puts a uniform effect over all in-season dates, while the latter quantify\nthe on-ramp and down-ramp. If you are not sure which effect to include, it's ok to include both\neffects. ``SILVERKITE`` has the option to use Ridge regression as the fit algorithm to avoid\nover-fitting too many features. Note that many datetime features could also be added to\nthe model as features. ``SILVERKITE`` calculates some of these features, which can be added to\n``extra_pred_cols`` as an arbitrary patsy expression.\nFor a full list of such features, see `~greykite.common.features.timeseries_features.build_time_features_df`.\n\nIf a feature is not automatically created by ``SILVERKITE``, we need to create it\nbeforehand and append it to the data df.\nHere we create the \"is_football_season\" feature.\nNote that we also need to provide the customized column for the forecast horizon period as well.\nThe way we do it is to first create the df with timestamps covering the forecast horizon.\nThis can be done with the `~greykite.framework.input.univariate_time_series.UnivariateTimeSeries.make_future_dataframe`\nfunction within the `~greykite.framework.input.univariate_time_series.UnivariateTimeSeries` class.\nThen we create a new column of our customized regressor for this augmented df.\n\n"

        "Summary in model tuning\n-----------------------\nAfter the example, you may have some sense about how to select parameters and tune the model.\nHere we list a few steps and tricks that might help select the best models.\nWhat you may do:\n\n  #. Detect anomaly points with the overlay plots\n     (`~greykite.framework.input.univariate_time_series.UnivariateTimeSeries.plot_quantiles_and_overlays`).\n     Mask these points with NA. Do not specify the adjustment unless you are confident about how to correct the anomalies.\n\n  #. Choose an appropriate way to model the growth (linear, quadratic, square root, etc.)\n     If none of the typical growth shape fits the time series, you might consider linear\n     growth with trend changepoints. Try different changepoint detection configurations.\n     You may also plot the detected changepoints and see if it makes sense to you.\n     The template also supports custom changepoints. If the automatic changepoint detection result\n     does not make sense to you, you might supply your own changepoints.\n\n  #. Choose the appropriate seasonality orders. The higher the order, the more details the model can learn.\n     However, too large orders could overfit the training data. These can also be detected from the\n     overlay plots (`~greykite.framework.input.univariate_time_series.UnivariateTimeSeries.plot_quantiles_and_overlays`).\n     There isn't a unified way to choose seasonality, so explore different seasonality orders and compare the results.\n\n  #. Consider what events and holidays to model. Are there any custom events we need to add?\n     If you add a custom event, remember also adding the dates for the event in the forecast period.\n\n  #. Add external regressors that could be related to the time series. Note that you will need to provide the\n     values of the regressors in the forecast period as well. You may use another time series as a regressor,\n     as long as you have a ground truth/good forecast for it that covers your forecast period.\n\n  #. Adding interaction terms. Let's mention again here that there could be interaction between two features\n     if the behaviors of one feature are different when the other feature have different values.\n     Try to detect this through the overlay plot\n     (`~greykite.framework.input.univariate_time_series.UnivariateTimeSeries.plot_quantiles_and_overlays`), too.\n     By default, we have a few pre-defined interaction terms, see\n     `feature_set_enabled <../../pages/model_components/0600_custom.html#interactions>`_.\n\n  #. Choose an appropriate fit algorithm. This is the algorithm that models the relationship between the features\n     and the time series. See a full list of available algorithms at\n     `fit_algorithm <../../pages/model_components/0600_custom.html#fit-algorithm>`_.\n     If you are unsure about their difference, try some of them and compare the results. If you don't want to, choosing \"ridge\"\n     is a safe option.\n\nIt is worth noting that the template supports automatic grid search with different sets of parameters.\nFor each parameter, if you provide the configuration in a list, it will automatically run each combination\nand choose the one with the best cross-validation performance. This will save a lot of time.\nFor details, see `grid search <../quickstart/0500_grid_search.html>`_.\n\n"
