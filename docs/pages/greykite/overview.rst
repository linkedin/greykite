The Greykite model
------------------
Greykite is a forecast library developed by LinkedIn.
Its flagship algorithm, Silverkite, provides interpretable, fast, and highly flexible
univariate forecasts that capture effects such as time-varying growth and seasonality,
autocorrelation, holidays, and regressors.
The Silverkite model offers pre-tuned templates (i.e. parameter configs) appropriate for different
forecast frequencies, horizons, and data patterns.
The library facilitates exploratory data analysis (EDA),
end-to-end forecasting, model tuning, and benchmarking.

Greykite also includes an interface for the Prophet model
developed by Facebook (``prophet``) and Auto-ARIMA (``pmdarima``).
